            <h3>Chennai Real Estate House Price Prediction</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Designed and implemented a highly accurate regression model to predict house prices in Chennai, utilizing extensive real estate data that included variables such as location, size, amenities, and historical price trends. The model was fine-tuned to capture the nuances of the Chennai real estate market, providing precise price predictions that aid both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions. This solution was then transformed into a user-friendly web application using Flask, ensuring easy access and interaction. The application was containerized with Docker, and deployed on Render.</p>

            <h3>Comparative Analysis of Machine/Deep Learning Models for Handwritten Digit Recognition</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Conducted an in-depth analysis of SVM, CNN, and KNN models for recognizing handwritten digits, comparing their accuracy and efficiency. The CNN model demonstrated the highest performance with an accuracy of 98%, significantly outperforming the SVM and KNN models, which achieved accuracies of 94% and 92%, respectively. The study also included evaluations of model efficiency in terms of training time and computational complexity, highlighting the CNN's superior balance between accuracy and performance.</p>

            <h3>Handwritten Signature Forgery Identification and Prediction using Harris Corner Detection and Siamese Network</h3>    
            <p>Published in IEEE on April 18, 2024.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Signature is a powerful identity of a person for various legal acts, to authorize a transactions to avoid financial crimes. Now-a-days, we are using touch-sensitive pad for the verification of the signatures. Thus there is high risk of forgery to happen due to replicate the signature patterns. So it is essential to detection and verify the signatures while using public platforms to avoid crime of accessing the personal data. The advancements in image processing and artificial neural network helps in identifying and validating genuine signature.
            
            This research focused on identifying and predicting forged handwritten signatures using advanced computer vision techniques. This paper proposed a signature validation process using harris corner detection and Siamese neural network. Harris corner detector helps to extract the corners and infer the features of an signature image, whereas Siamese network identifies the pattern of signature by learning with the help of similarity function by taking the probability of the signature images
